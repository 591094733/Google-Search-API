Todo list for Google-Search-API
====

## Next tasks

- [x] Mock html test for search images
- [ ] Refactor and split main modules in separated ones
- [ ] Write tests for future methods development (they should failed and be skipped up to the proper method development moment)
- [ ] Be able to manage both Chrome and Firefox, and maybe Ie too, depending in what browser the user has
- [ ] Write a full suite of docs test and unit tests

## Stuff to check out later on

* vcrpy to record web requests and make more automated mocks
* SauceLabs to do UI tests
* Sphinx to generate documentation - readthedocs style
* Cookiecutter-pythonpackage to make an instant and complete python package structure
* PhantomJS to use browsers without actually opening them (works with selenium)
* Understand UTF-8 encoding in the context of getting html, writing it into a file and getting it back
